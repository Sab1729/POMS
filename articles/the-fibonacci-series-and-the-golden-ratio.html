                            <p>
                                The Fibonacci Series is built from the previous terms. The Series starts with 1 and 1. Every other term in the Series is the sum of the previous two terms in the Series. Hence, the third term will be \(1 + 1 = 2\) and the next term is \(1 + 2 = 3\) and so on. In symbols, we write:
                                \[
                                F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2},
                                \]
                                where \(F_{n}\) is the \(n^{th}\) term of the Fibonacci Series, given \(F_{1} = 1\) and \(F_{2} = 1\).

                            <h3>2. The Golden Ratio</h3>
                            <p>
                                The Greek letter \(\Phi\) (phi) is used to denote a constant like \(\pi = 3.14159...\).
                                \[
                                \Phi = 1.61803...
                                \]
                                The number \(\Phi\) is special for its powers:
                                \[
                                \Phi^1 = 1.61803...
                                \]
                                \[
                                \Phi^2 = 2.61803...
                                \]
                                You can see that the numbers after the decimal point are the same in both \(\Phi\) and \(\Phi^2\), and we can relate both as \(\Phi^2 = \Phi + 1\). We can solve for \(\Phi\) in this quadratic to get:
                                \[
                                \Phi = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}.
                                \]
                                The positive root of this equation is \(\Phi = 1.61803...\):
                                \[
                                \Phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.
                                \]
                                \(\Phi\) is known by its more popular name, the "Golden Ratio". The Golden Ratio has been known since ancient times and has been used in art since that time. Many objects are called "Golden" if the ratio is directly or indirectly related via the quadratic.

                            <h3>3. Connection between \(\Phi\) and the Fibonacci Series</h3>
                            <p>
                                The list of the first few numbers of the Fibonacci Series is:
                                \[
                                1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, \cdots
                                \]
                                The ratios of two consecutive terms, when written in a certain way, have some pattern as shown:
                                \[
                                \frac{F_2}{F_1} = \frac{1}{1}
                                \]
                                \[
                                \frac{F_3}{F_2} = \frac{2}{1} = 1 + \frac{1}{1}
                                \]
                                \[
                                \frac{F_4}{F_3} = \frac{3}{2} = 1 + \frac{1}{\frac{2}{1}} = 1 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{1}}
                                \]
                                \[
                                \frac{F_5}{F_4} = \frac{5}{3} = 1 + \frac{1}{\frac{3}{2}} = 1 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{1}}}
                                \]
                                \[
                                \vdots
                                \]
                                These are called continued fractions. This pattern can be explained by how the Fibonacci Series is defined:
                                \[
                                F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2},
                                \]
                                hence,
                                \[
                                \frac{F_{n}}{F_{n-1}} = \frac{F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}}{F_{n-1}} = 1 + \frac{1}{\frac{F_{n-1}}{F_{n-2}}}.
                                \]
                                By definition, \(F_{n-1} = F_{n-2} + F_{n-3}\). On solving, we get:
                                \[
                                \frac{F_{n}}{F_{n-1}} = 1 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{\frac{F_{n-2}}{F_{n-3}}}}.
                                \]
                                This pattern will continue on. For large values of \(n\), we can write:
                                \[
                                \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{F_{n}}{F_{n-1}} = 1 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{\ddots}}} = x \ (\text{say}).
                                \]
                                We can solve for \(x\) as the big denominator is the same \(x\). Hence, we get:
                                \[
                                1 + \frac{1}{x} = x \quad \text{that is} \quad x^2 = x + 1.
                                \]
                                \(x^2 = x + 1\) is the same equation whose positive root is \(\Phi\). We conclude:
                                \[
                                \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{F_{n}}{F_{n-1}} = \Phi \quad \text{(a)}.
                                \]
                                The Fibonacci Series and the Golden Ratio (\(\Phi\)) are found in nature, in flowers, fruits, etc. Equation (a) shows how they are related.
